## Emacs exercises
Set of exercises related to common Emacs commands. Emacs is a free text editor originally created by Richard Stallman and released by the GNU software foundation. Each file's title is the purporse of the command contained within. As with the Emacs documentation, `C-` stands for the control key, e.g. `C-x` is control + 'x'.
